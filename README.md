# Changelog
- Created get_rows_by_column_value function that reads a given file line-by-line and appends that line to a new list if the column index is equal to the column value. The function returns the new list.
- Updated the print_fires file to use the function outlined above.
- Note for the grader: The assignment instructions were very confusing and sometimes contradictory, especially in terms of the commented sections in the print_fires file, so I did my best to interpret the assignment but I apologize if my code is different from what was anticipated or required.
